    summary: Interesting language I want to learn, good complement for NodeJS applications.
---

Rust is a nice language I want to learn. It works well in combination with Node projects: you can import `Rust` functions directly into your NodeJS application. This means you can have a NodeJS application, which offers short time-to-market and decent performance in certain scenarios, and inject `Rust` functions to make certain flows fast.
I haven't tested this yet, but it's definitely a language that I want to learn.
