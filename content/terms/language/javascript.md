I have been using JavaScript since the dark ages (even) before JQuery. It was a nice discovery, after some years using _serious_ languages, such as [](c) / [](c++).

Developing with JS felt like magic, can I assign this function to this object and just call it using reflection? Just magic.

But all the magic comes with a cost, ain't it? And JavaScript is not an exception. Is really fun language to play with, but it's also very easy to make simple mistakes that can bring your application down. That's why I was very interested on [](TypeScript) when I found it, since there we can ensure we are doing what we are supposed to be doing :)
