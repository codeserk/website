I'm revamping some of the games I made using Unity in the past (some jam games, and the games I made when I was _working as freelance_).


I remember I struggled a lot when I had to create _async_ mechanisms, like making a call to an API. That was **AWFUL**, we had to use `IEnumerable` and do some very weird stuff. It was painful to compare that to other ways of doing _async_ communication  in other languages like `JS`.

But the suffering **is over**. With `Unity 5+` and `.NET 4.0` they have introduced `async` / `await` and many other features!

Work in progress...
