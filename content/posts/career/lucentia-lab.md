This was my first job after finishing the degree on `Computer Science`. _Lucentia lab_ is a research group based in the _University of Alicante_ which performs analysis to companies applying [Business Intelligence](business-intelligence) technologies. My role in the company was to support the researchers: I helped them conducting the experiments and then presenting the findings using [](web) technologies.

I learnt a lot about Business Intelligence, using tools like [](pentaho). I also continued my journey into the [](web), and I had the opportunity to test new technologies in both Backend and Fronted. We used [](sailsjs) (a Framework for NodeJS) for some of the backend solutions, and [](angular-1) for the presentation layer.

It was quite interesting period and I learnt a lot, but I realised I needed to move on, since I was not so interested on Business Intelligence.
