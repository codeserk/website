I quit my previous job because I needed some time to discover new technologies and try to develop some ideas. I saved money so I could be a few months only working on these projects. **None of them was a big success though**, but I learnt a lot in the process. I was so focused that I used to work for around _12 hours_ a day, _6-7 days a week_ (I was often top 5 in [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com/)). After all, I was working for myself, and _a third party_... and I was young, I guess.

## Meeting Point
During the first months, I started developing [Meeting Point](/project/web/meeting-point), an app where you would be able to share your thoughts with the people nearby. I used [](sailsjs) as main Framework for the Backend, using [](mongodb) for persistence and [](redis) for cache. The first approach was to develop a single web Frontend using [](angular-1), and make that work in mobile devices using [](phonegap). But oh boy, if that was buggy:

* The application was highly dependant on [](websockets), and that didn't work very well with embedded web apps.
* I put a lot of efforts to make the website `responsive`, but the UX was not great, you could easily tell that it was just a website pretending to be an app.

Having that in mind, I decided to start implementing a native [](android) app, which was fun to learn, but also a big stone in the path.

This project was a **big failure** for many reasons, but I'm happy of all the things I could learn during this time :) Besides, I was able to present all the work I had done in this project during my interview for a position at [Square 1](/career/square1) (which showed that I had some experience in [](web)), so it was helpful after all!

## Game development
I also experienced with [](game) development during this time. I worked on two projects using [](unity):
* [Asteroids!](/project/game/ivy): A simple arcade game
* [Arena Heroes](/project/game/callet): A reaction game, with RPG touch. I continued working on this project even after I joined [Square 1](/career/square1).
