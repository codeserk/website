So... [](ionic) it is!

I've spent the day testing the library. For now I just have a very basic navigation using routes (_journal_, _oracle_, _settings_). I've tested some builds, to ensure this will work in all the platforms I'm targeting:

* I've generated a _normal_ build for [](web) ✅
* I've generated a build for [](android)  ✅
* I've generated a build for [](ios)  ✅

The results in mobile apps was **surprisingly good**! I couldn't tell that it was not a native app, it just looked and felt like one :). This was a good day!
