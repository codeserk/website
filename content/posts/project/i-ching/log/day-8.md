I've finished all the preparations to finally have a first release. For now it's just a [](web) release (as web app and PWA). I had to tweak a lot of stuff before making this _production ready_. I had to generate icons, manifest, PWA stuff...

But, before preparing this web release, I had to make it nice for _big screens_ (`Tablets` and _normal_ web users). What is nice about this is that I could make changes for both targets, I don't regret at all choosing this technology :) (for now!)
