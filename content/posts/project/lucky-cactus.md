This project is still even before _design phase_, but I'm looking forward to working on this :)

The idea is to create an app where people can **ask for luck** about a certain topic:

> I have an interview, please wish me luck!

...while other players can **give luck**, doing something silly in the app.

The strong points of this app should be social interaction and _cuteness_, we'll see how that goes though.

This is just an idea for now, but I think it would be a nice opportunity to keep learning [](ios) and [](android).
