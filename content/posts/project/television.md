This is the first [](ios) application I developed. It was great stepping out from [](web) and trying something completely new.

Learning [](swift) was nice, although it was a bit chaotic since I couldn't find a good place with tutorials, guides and such. The fact that `Apple` decided to completely change the API from one version  to another didn't help a lot either...

I **couldn't publish this application** though, since the way I got the video streams was a bit _fishy_. It was a good opportunity to work in this environment.
