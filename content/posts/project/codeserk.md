The implementation of this website is an evolution of the implementation of [Avellana Color√°](/project/web/avellanacolora). This public website uses [Press](/project/web/press) library that I built in [](typescript).

The library reads all the content from the local filesystem (mostly from `markdown` files) and provides all scaffolding to build a public website. This application is built using [](nuxt), which makes `SSG` easy as hell.
