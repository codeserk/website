This is the second day I work on this project. Basic flow is in place now.

I've decided to use [](vue)'s `composition API`, and I'm quite happy about it. It was a bit difficult at first (coming from _classic Vue_ projects), but it's very easy to adapt (the same terms exist, only they are used in a different way). It was also great being able to use all the features from TS. It was _somehow_ possible before, but using types in components often lead to weird errors because it was not able to tell that this _prop_ was of this type (which meant _using `any`_ a lot of times).
