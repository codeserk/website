This is just the first day, not very amusing (designing, scoping etc.).

One of the most important things to scope the project (I don't want this to ber 1 year kind of project), and split into different _phases_ / _sprints_.
The first iteration will be very simple: **without authentication nor external storage**. This will not bring all the desired value, but it's a good starting point from which we can add features :)
