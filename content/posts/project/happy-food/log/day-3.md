It's important to lock the Play view, so users giving feedback can't go out that view.

I've been improving this view, and I've created a _modal_ to unlock it (for now it unlocks with any code though).

<div class="flex no-skew no-skew-padding">
  <div class="flex-1">
    <img src="project/happy-food/screenshot-lock-1" />
  </div>
  <div class="flex-1">
    <img src="project/happy-food/screenshot-lock-2" />
  </div>
</div>
