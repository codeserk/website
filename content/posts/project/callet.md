> Teach your heroes how to fight and become a legendary Arena Master!

**Arena Heroes** is a game made using [](unity), with some assets made by myself (like the coliseum) and some of them bought. It was a collaboration with a friend from college, [Manel S](https://twitter.com/manelizzard), and it was a ton of fun to develop :)

The main mechanic of this game involves reaction time: you need to act fast to defend from your foes correctly. Your fighter learns from your _play-style_ and reproduces it in _online_ fights against other players.

The backend side of this project was `Parse.com` originally, but that project died :( I have recently migrated the backend to [](firebase), which seems to work as good as the old one.
