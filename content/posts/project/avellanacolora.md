Colorful brand portfolio for Avellana Colorá. The implementation of this website was an evolution of the implementation of [AJ+B website](/project/web/angelaberenguer).

This public website uses [Press](/project/web/press) library that I built in [](typescript). The library reads all the content from a [](wordpress) instance and provides all scaffolding to build a public website. This application is built using [](nuxt), which makes `SSG` easy as hell.
